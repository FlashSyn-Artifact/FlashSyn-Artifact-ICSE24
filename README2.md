# Purpose:
Include a list of badge(s) the authors are applying for as well as the reasons why the authors believe that the artifact deserves that badge(s).

## Badges:
    We are applying for 
    1. available 
    2. reusable
    3. results reproduced


# Provenance: 
    where the artifact can be obtained, preferably with a link to the paper’s preprint if publicly available.


# Data: 
    cover aspects related to understanding the context, data provenance, ethical and legal statements (as long as relevant), and storage requirements.


# Setup (for executable artifacts): 

## Hardware: 
        The executable should be able to run on common laptops or desktops. However, running the artifact on a laptop could lead to 
        failures of 1-3 benchmarks because solving these benchmarks requires expensive computational resources to perform the optimizations.
 
## Software: 
    To use this artifact, the following dependencies are required:
    - A working installation of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    - Bash

## Disk Usage:
    provide clear instructions for how to prepare the artifact for execution. This includes:
    
    Hardware: performance, storage, and device-type (e.g. GPUs) requirements.
    Software: Docker or VM requirements, or operating system & package dependencies if not provided as a container or VM. Providing a Dockerfile or image, or at least confirming the tool’s installation in a container is strongly encouraged. Any deviation from standard environments needs to be reasonably justified.



# Usage (for executable artifacts): 

    A basic usage example to test the installation:
